# Machine Learning Portfolio by Fabian Salvador
This repository serves as an overview of the machine learning projects I've completed. Each project's README.md file contains a comprehensive description of the project. Here, I'll provide brief summaries for each project. All projects are written in Python, and links are provided to projects where the code can be publicly accessed.
